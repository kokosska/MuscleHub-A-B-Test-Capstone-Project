# MuscleHub A/B Test Capstone Project
 
Task Details: For this project, you'll have to access SQL in a slightly different way. You'll be using a special Codecademy library that lets you type SQL queries directly into this Jupyter notebook. You'll have pass each SQL query as an argument to a function called sql_query. Each query will return a Pandas DataFrame. 

In this project I'll perform hypothesis testing.
